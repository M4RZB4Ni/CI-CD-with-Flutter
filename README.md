# Flutter Project with Simple CI/CD Configuration

To save time in the development this repository was cloned from my other repository as a template.
for the architecture and other things please refer to this link:
https://github.com/M4RZB4Ni/Flutter-Clean-Architecture-with-GetX

I've added simple configuration files for each CI/CD base on my experience in working with each one
and the repository will get updates based on my free time to expand it.

your contributions are always welcome :)

before running the project executes these commands in the terminal:

1-flutter pub get
2-flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

and remember to turn on your VPN before starting the application (the web service is filtered).

Best Wishes
Hamidreza
